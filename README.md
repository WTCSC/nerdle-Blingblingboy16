## Nerdle Game
##### Savannah Finn
> This program is an interactive game that allows users to pretty much just play Wordle but with numbers. The idea is to create an 8 character equation using +, -, *, / and = to figure out the randomly generated problem the computer made. 
##### Requirements
* Python3
##### Startup and Gameplay
start the program by entering ```python3 nerdle.py``` into your terminal
>Start by entering your 8 digit equation (10+10=20, for example) and see which numbers are correct, present or absent using the color key.
##### It should look something like this-
```
--- Welcome to Nerdle! ---
Enter your 8 digit equation with the allowed operations
```

###### Don't use any unamed operations, make an equation with 8 characters and pay attention to the color key :P
